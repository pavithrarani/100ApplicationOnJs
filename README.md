Here will be creating 100 application which is purely written using Javascript! yes I want to know head and tail of this JS.


This document mainly focus on how a C++ developer can start working on web technologies and what comparision is right when it comes to C++ handling.

1. Basics of Java script
    > learnt how to view the content on web with javascript provided elements. HTML invokes this Javascript.
    > then all the basic constructs. Best was this pointer in javascript. Its so easy to mention of update this object.
    (no constructos required Yay!)
    
2. Execution contexts and stacks.
    > this also looks very clean compare to C++. Var objects takes care of most of the thing. 
      
    
    Update as on 10th Nov 2019.
    
    Doubt: Here comes the pointer and its handling. Is there a pointer in JS? 
    if not there how is this pass by value ,pass by reference only applied to pointers in c++?
    Simply how to play with Address of the variable in JS?
